# Fix iOS Project Issues

## Current Problems:
1. ✅ Removed Package.swift (conflicting with Xcode project)
2. ✅ Removed duplicate ProjectChimera.xcodeproj from wrong location
3. ⚠️ Need to fix Info.plist generation issue

## Steps to Fix in Xcode:

### 1. Open the Project
- The project should now be open in Xcode
- If not, open `/Users/patrickjanuszyk/Desktop/ProjectChimera/ProjectChimera.xcodeproj`

### 2. Fix Info.plist Issue
In Xcode:
1. Select the **ProjectChimera** project in the navigator
2. Select the **ProjectChimera** target
3. Go to **Build Settings** tab
4. Search for "Info.plist"
5. Find **Info.plist File** setting
6. Set it to: `ProjectChimera/Info.plist`
7. Or set **Generate Info.plist File** to **No**

### 3. Set iOS Deployment Target
1. In the same target settings
2. Go to **General** tab
3. Set **Deployment Target** to **iOS 17.0**

### 4. Add Missing Files
Make sure all Swift files are added to the target:
1. In the Project Navigator, select all `.swift` files
2. Right-click → **Add Files to "ProjectChimera"**
3. Make sure **Add to target** is checked for **ProjectChimera**

### 5. Build and Run
1. Select your iPhone 16 Pro as the target device
2. Press Cmd+R to build and run

## If Still Having Issues:

### Alternative: Create Fresh Project
1. Create a new iOS App project in Xcode
2. Set iOS Deployment Target to 17.0
3. Copy all `.swift` files and `Assets.xcassets` to the new project
4. Add them to the target
5. Build and run

The key is ensuring iOS 17.0 deployment target and proper Info.plist configuration.
